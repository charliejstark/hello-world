# hello-world
The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new.

My name is Charlie Stark and I study biomedical engineering at Northwestern University. My favorite albums are: Yeezus by Kanye West, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea by Neutral Milk Hotel, and Dookie by Green Day.
